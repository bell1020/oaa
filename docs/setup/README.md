## FAQ

Here's some answers to commonly asked questions:

"Where do i post my ideas?" well here's the thing: you are welcome to post your ideas in #help channels in the Discord server, but they will get lost in the sands of time guaranteed. The best place to post ideas has always been the [OAA Suggestions Github][3]

"Where/how do i post my bug reports?" Same deal as with the suggestions, you are welcome to post in #help, but again, we'd much rather keep them in the [OAA Bug-reports Github][4] (please no double posting. Check first)!

"How do I get started working?" You'll need to [Setup your client][1]. Then if you're a coder make sure you have [What you need][2]. Finally, head over to your channel in the Discord and get started! Tickets can be found in the [OAA Main Github][5]. Good luck!
