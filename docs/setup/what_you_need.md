### Programming Tools:

First and obvious: we do need the Workshop Tools for dota. You can find it if you click once on dota in your steam library and under DLC:

As Scripting-Programmers we mostly work on Text-Files. So we also need a Texteditor. Recommended: Atom - http://www.atom.io
If you donâ€™t want to use Atom, these are the requirements:
- It should have syntax-highlighting for lua, HTML, JS, XML, 
- It should have on-the-fly linting
- it MUST respect .editorconfig http://editorconfig.org/


Now you have to install Lua (for linting) and node.js
https://nodejs.org/en/download/
http://www.lua.org


If use you Atom, following Packages / Plugins you should use:
- language-lua
- linter
- linter-lua
- linter-eslint
- linter-luaparse
- editorconfig
