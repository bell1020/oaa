# Chat commands

Updated 2017-12-05

[< Dota 2 Tools][0]

Commands to be used for debugging and testing purposes, currently requires the game to either be in tools mode or have sv_cheats 1 enabled. To use these types them into the chat prompt like you would messaging allies. <b>As for now, there is a bug that prevents the chat listener from working on workshop mode, and thus none of these commands will work in upload versions, only in tools mode.</b>
