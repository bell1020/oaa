## Introduction

Filing a bug report is easy, but we do ask that you follow the proper procedure. First go to http://www.github.com/openangelarena/bug-reports/issues and see if someone has reported it already. If so, drop a comment giving your own account of the bug. If it hasn't been reported, there's just a few specific details that should be included in every bug report outlined in the following Bug Report Template.
