# Installing Open Angel Arena

Updated 2017-12-05

[< Setup][0]

You have to set up several things before you can run a local instance of OAA for development.

## System Dependencies
Start by installing these programs:
 * Windows
 * [Steam](http://steampowered.com)
 * [nodejs](http://nodejs.org)
 * [Github client](http://desktop.github.com/) Use the download link at the bottom of the page
 * [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/) **optional**

Install the Dota 2 Workshop Tools.
 * From within steam, right click on `Dota 2` and select `Properties` at the bottom
 * Go to the DLC tab of the window that pops up
 * Check the `INSTALL` box next to `Dota 2 Workshop Tools DLC`

## Addon Tool
Open the command prompt by pressing `Windows + R` and entering `cmd` in the new window. 

### Install Node Dependencies
Run the commands
```
npm install -g dota2-addon-manager
npm install
```
This will install `d2am`, used to manage the addons directory, and other tools/node modules you might need for development later.

### Prepare Addon Directory
Next find your `dota 2 beta` folder. You must change the directory of the node.js command prompt to this folder, this can be done with the `cd` command. It should look something like this...
```
cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\
```
**Note**: The directory path may be different depending on how you installed Steam. If Steam is installed on another drive you'll need to change drives using the letter then a `:` symbol. For example, `E:`.

To ensure the addons directory is set up, run
```
d2am list
```
leave the command prompt open, we'll come back to it. Join us on iscordDay, the URL ends in WNFBB4d. You found the easter egg!

## Get The Addon
Instead of just Cloning (copying the OpenAngelArena/oaa repository) you'll create a Fork of it and work from there.
If you do not already have a GitHub.com Account, create one [here](https://GitHub.com/join).

## Forking
Forking creates a simultaneous instance of oaa within your own GitHub repository.
- Goto OpenAngelArena/oaa.
- Click Fork
- Choose where to Fork: Fork OpenAngelArena/oaa to YOURUSERNAME/oaa
- Done! If you go to `GitHub.com/YOURUSERNAME/oaa` you'll see your own fork of [OpenAngelArena/oaa].

## Cloning
Now just Clone your Fork to \dota 2 beta\addons. We do this using the GitHub client. You can do basic things with the GitHub Client, but you will want to familiarize yourself with the command-line. GitHub Client comes with a built-in version of PowerShell (a command-line interface which enables you to type Git commands). This will be explained later.

- Open the GitHub Client you installed earlier in [install.md](/docs/install.md).
- Click settings.
- Change the settings how you like it (e.g. Change to Dark mode).
- While in settings, changing the default shell to PowerShell.
- Click Save.
- Click on the "+" in the upper left corner.
- Select Clone.
- Select your Account and the forked `oaa` repository.
- Verify Clone to your repo.
Now we should have a local copy of your fork of [OpenAngelArena/oaa]

**You must link the addon before it will work**. You can do this from that same node.js window you had open by running
```
d2am link
```
You will see output about creating links for `oaa` game and content.

## Launch Tools
Next we open the actual addon! This is done by right clicking on `Dota 2` from Steam and selecting "Launch Dota 2 - Tools". It should be the second option on the dropdown below "Play Game..."

Select `oaa` below `Custom Games` and click `Launch Custom Game Tools`. `Dota 2` and `Asset Browser` will open. To start the game, open the Vconsole (click the monitor icon on the top) and type 'dota_launch_custom_game oaa oaa'. Switch to the `Dota 2` window, if everything worked the game will start loading. 
If you get the error 'Unable to load map specified by server', it means you have to first build the map in Hammer (map editor tool). Go back to 'Asset Browser' and click the hammer icon on the top left. Open one of the maps (probably oaa) and click the gamepad sybol to test the gamemode. Open `oaa.vmap` and click the gamepad icon on the top (or press `F9`). Untick `Load in engine after building` and click `Build`. This might take some time. Try to launch the game again.

Now you are ready to start developing. Read the [Github guide](/docs/github-for-noobs.md) to learn about contributing. In case you are already familiar with Github there are [other guides](/docs/).
