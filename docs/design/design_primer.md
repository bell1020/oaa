## Boss Concepts
1. When submitting, outline purely the mechanics.
2. Be concise and to-the-point. Don't bother with number-values and lore.
3. Boss fights should last 2 minutes or less (assuming players are of appropiate power level).
4. Bosses should rely heavily on a few interesting active abilities
5. Successfully completing Boss encounters is a function of (learning x reacting).
6. Boss encounters are multistage (3-stages as a rule) becoming increasingly difficult each stage.
7. Each stage adds on top of the previous stage, teaching players the Boss's mechanics before becoming difficult later.
8. Players should understand Bosses' abilities without having to read them.

## Game Design

1. Design should aim to increase the number of viable builds/strategies.
  We wish the meta to be as healthy as possible, and this means a diverse ecosystem of strategies and builds. Something which completely neuters a currently viable strategy at negligible cost, or is so good nothing else is viable, is bad design.
2. Designs should provide incentive for players to act as intended
  Assume people will go for the optimal play. If a mechanic stimulates players to do something which is against how we intend the game to function (say, it makes fountain camping an optimal late game strat), then it is bad design.
3. Design should promote the core gameplay.
  This goes hand in hand with the previous point. Each game has a draw, something players get out of it. In our case, it's a combination of ridiculous teamfights, challenging bosses, and the power trip value of heroes way more powerful than they are in Dota. Designs which reinforce these feelings are good designs. Designs which go against these - say, by reducing player agency, or making a boss fight boring or repetitive, are bad designs.
